# SCSS Theme
This is basically the source of the theme itself, made it SCSS.
Please follow the SCSS Lint as I heavily follow it myself to keep the source good :3

# How to get started

- 1 Install Ruby | https://rubyinstaller.org/
- 2 Install SASS | `(sudo) gem install sass`
- 3 Watch the files in SASS with CSS, either use the .scss-lint.bat or the command `sass --watch scss/.` in root folder
- 4 Be sure to keep the code linter friendly ([sudo] gem install scss_lint)

To always watch from Discord_Theme folder, use the command `sass --watch scss:.`
