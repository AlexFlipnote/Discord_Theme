## About theme
***Discord_Theme*** theme is made by **AlexFlipnote#0021** & **CyberRonin#5517**<br>
This was made to let everyone who wants, able to have a more good-looking style. It supports any plugins (almost, depends if the import URL is custom made for 1 theme).

## FAQ

to change stuff, download the **theme.css**, however if you wish for a theme that updates, use **autotheme.css**

**How do I use plugins?**<br>Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/Documentation.md), then get some plugins [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/Plugins.md)
