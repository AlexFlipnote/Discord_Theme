# Discord_Theme
A custom CSS made to change your discord style<br>
This theme does also **force** you to Dark Theme, be aware of that<br>

## FAQ
**Where can I talk with you?**<br>Here: https://discord.gg/J4mwTJR

**What should I use, theme.css or autotheme.css?**<br>That really depends on you. If you are a developer and want
to change stuff, download the theme.css, however if you wish for a theme that updates, use autotheme.css :P

**How do I use the theme?**<br>[BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/beautiful-discord-community/resources/wiki/Installing-BeautifulDiscord) should be useful to use the skin

**Does it support BetterDiscord?**<br>Yes, however I do highly recommended **BeautifulDiscord**
(You can fint BetterDiscord version in assets folder)

**The theme looks weird...**<br>There is a reason why it's on alpha stage ;)

**I found a bug, what do I do?**<br>Either tell me the problem or make a Pull Request / Issue</a>
