## Disclaimer
This theme does **force** you to Dark Theme, be aware of that (However a light theme plugin is being made)<br>
This theme also has no connections with [BeardDesign1/Material-design-theme](https://github.com/BeardDesign1/Material-design-theme),
the only thing that is in common is the base look.

## FAQ
**Where can I talk with you?**<br>Here: https://discord.gg/J4mwTJR

**What should I use, theme.css or autotheme.css?**<br>That really depends on you. If you are a developer and want
to change stuff, download the theme.css, however if you wish for a theme that updates, use **autotheme.css** :P

**How can I get a background on this theme?**<br>Use the **autotheme.css** and import the plugin from [PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/PLUGINS.md)

**How do I use plugins?**<br>There should be a screenshot of an example in [PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/PLUGINS.md)

**How do I use the theme?**<br>[BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/beautiful-discord-community/resources/wiki/Installing-BeautifulDiscord) should be useful to use the skin

**Does it support BetterDiscord?**<br>Yes, however I do highly recommended to use **BeautifulDiscord**<br>
( You can find BetterDiscord version [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/Discord_Theme/blob/master/assets/BetterDiscord.theme.css) )

**I found a bug, what do I do?**<br>Either tell me the problem on Discord ( **AlexFlipnote#0021** ) or make a **Pull Request / Issue**
